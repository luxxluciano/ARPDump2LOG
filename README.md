# ARPDump2LOG
This script will first dump the current ARP cache to the specified log file.

Here is a simple script that you can use to automate the process of dumping the ARP cache to a log file every time the ARP cache is updated:


#!/bin/bash

# Set the log file path
log_file="/var/log/arp_cache.log"

# Dump the ARP cache to the log file
arp -a >> $log_file

# Monitor the ARP cache for changes and update the log file
while true; do
  arp -a > /tmp/arp_cache
  diff /tmp/arp_cache $log_file > /dev/null
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    arp -a >> $log_file
  fi
  sleep 1
done

     
This script will first dump the current ARP cache to the specified log file, and then it will enter an infinite loop that checks the ARP cache for changes every second. If the ARP cache has been updated, the script will append the new ARP cache to the log file.

You can run this script by making it executable with the chmod command and then executing it with ./script.sh. You may also want to consider adding it to your system's startup scripts so that it runs automatically whenever the system boots.
